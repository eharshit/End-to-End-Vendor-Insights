# End-to-End-Vendor-Insights

## Project Overview

This project is a company-standard, end-to-end data analytics solution for Vendor Performance Data Analytics using SQL, Python, Power BI, and reporting. It is designed to reflect real-world practices followed by top data analysts in industry, focusing on integrating multiple tools and skills to solve a genuine business problem.

### **Objective**
To analyze vendor and brand performance, optimize pricing and inventory, and provide actionable insights for profitability improvement in a retail/wholesale context.

### **Key Business Questions**
- Identify underperforming brands needing promotional/pricing adjustments.
- Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit.
- Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit cost.
- Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs.
- Investigate profitability variance between high and low-performing vendors.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. **Define Business Problem**
- Clearly state the business objectives and the key questions to be answered (e.g., vendor performance, pricing, inventory optimization).

### 2. **Collect and Ingest Raw Data**
- Source: Multiple CSV files (e.g., purchase, purchase prices, vendor invoice, inventory, sales).
- Store all CSVs as tables in a relational database (SQLite for demo, but could be any RDBMS in production).
- Write a Python script to ingest CSVs into the database, with logging for monitoring and error tracking.

### 3. **Explore Database Tables, Merge & Clean Data (SQL)**
- Explore the structure and content of all relevant tables in the database.
- Merge tables as needed to bring together all necessary data.
- Clean the data (handle missing values, fix types, remove inconsistencies).

### 4. **Create Aggregated Table**
- Aggregate the cleaned data into a summary table (e.g., vendor sales summary).
- This table should contain all the features needed for analysis (sales, purchases, profit, etc.).
- Store the aggregated table back into the database for easy access and to avoid repeated heavy computations.

### 5. **Load Aggregated Table in Jupyter Notebook (Python)**
- Use Python (Pandas, etc.) to load the aggregated data for deeper analysis.
- Perform:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data Cleaning (if needed)
  - Solving research/business questions
  - Analyzing and interpreting findings

### 6. **Create Dashboard in Power BI**
- Visualize key findings and metrics using Power BI.
- Build interactive dashboards for stakeholders to explore the data and insights.

### 7. **Report Writing**
- Document the process, findings, and recommendations.
- Prepare presentations or written reports for stakeholders, management, or clients.
